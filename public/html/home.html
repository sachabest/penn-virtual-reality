<h2>Welcome to CIS 568-002: Virtual Reality Practicum</h2>

<h4>Instructors: <a href="https://sachabest.com">Sacha Best</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trungtuanle">Trung Le</a></h4>
<h4>TAs:  <a href="https://sachabest.com">Emily Vo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trungtuanle">Jian Ru</a></h4>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>

<p>
Students should gain a solid, breadth based understanding of the tools that exist to bridge the gap between virtual reality hardware and computing software. This includes, but is not limited to, Unreal Engine 4, Unity3D, Three.js, and Google’s Daydream.
</p>
<p>
However, this course is not one in game design, nor pure graphics. The tools and concepts covered will be exclusively those relevant to virtual reality development, and it so happens that certain concepts in graphics and game engines are required to work in VR. 
</p>
<p>
After an intensive, 12 week seminar, students should be able to quickly create projects on at minimum two of the aforementioned platforms, and gain experience in developing an interactive application through a capstone project in teams of 3-5. 
</p>

<h2>Some Notes</h2>

<ul>

<li>Tuesday classes will be lectures and tutorials. Lectures are recorded and available <a ui-sref="main.lectures">here</a></li>
<li>Thursday classes will be lab sessions: this is your chance to work around others solving the same problems, with supervised help</li>
<li>Assignments go out on Tuesdays, and are due on Tuesdays. Late assignments will be accepted until the Thursday class after which they were due for 75% credit, unless otherwise cleared.</li>
<li>This is a first run. The course structure will be fluid; if something doesn’t work, or is not doable in the given time, we will adapt. Do not think rules are set in stone.</li>
</ul>
